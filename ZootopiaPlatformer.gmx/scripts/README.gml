//Major changes:
/*
    1. obj_Global:
        this will handle character swapping, HUD drawing, pausing,
        and other things.
        Created once, persistent through the rooms.
        
    2. New dialogue engine:
        I've replaced the current dialogue engine with my own engine
        from my Pokémon fangame. It fits very well since Pokémon also
        uses the same two types of dialogue you're using, and it's
        easier to work with.
