Zootopia Fangame Repository

Hey everybody! This is the public repository for the currently still-untitled Zootopia fangame.

Making this game is going to be a long, challenging, and likely very difficult process, especially for a single person. So, if you liked Zootopia and would like to contribute, consider yourself already on the team. I could use all the help I can get. 

To contact me about helping out with the game's development or other issues that might arise, I can be reached at pixelhavokk@gmail.com.
